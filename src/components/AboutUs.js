                <p>Omart is a one stop shop about all things eco-friendly in Kenya. Our aim is to sell products that are sourced, manufactured and shipped in eco-friendly ways and only works with manufacturers using better materials like upcycled cotton and bamboo. </p>

                <h2>THE STORY</h2> 
                <p> Too much of the stuff we buy today is made without any thought about tomorrow. Our landfills are growing while our resources are disappearing-it's just not sustainable. The future of our planet depends on the actions we take today, but the truth is, it's just not that easy to make every shoppong decision a mindfjul one.
                What if there was a better way to shop? The ease and convenience you're used to, but everything's made in a way that treats our planet kindly. </p>
                <strong>That's where Omart comes in.</strong>
                <p> As an eco-friendly online marketplace, Omart has done the work so you don't have to. Here you can pick from products that are sourced, manufactured and shipped in a way that protects our planet's future. Each brand we've partnered with has been chosen because they're taking the right steps and helping to create a more sustainable future
                Our goal is to make buying responsibly second-nature. We're on a mission to make it normal to consume ij a way that's easier on the environment, while meeting the convenience we've come to expect.</p>
                <h2> But this is not a story about Omart, This is a story about all of us</h2>

                <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
